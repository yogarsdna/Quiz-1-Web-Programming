                <h1>About My Hometown</h1>
                <br>
                <p>My hometown is Bali, it's a wonderful place but unfortunately, I rarely visit it, because I actually live in Balikpapan but was born in Bali. For me, Bali is the best place to visit and of course to live, it has a lot of beautiful scenery, and I always got relaxing vibes in Bali. There are also many places that can be visited with your friends, family, or maybe your loved one. Trust me, you will never regret and will be addicted to coming to my hometown!</p>
